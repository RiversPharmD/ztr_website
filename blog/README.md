# Blog Posts

This directory contains all my blog posts. Each post should be written in its own `.qmd` file in the `posts/` directory.

## Using the Template

1. Copy `posts/_template.qmd` to create a new blog post:
   ```bash
   cp posts/_template.qmd posts/my-new-post.qmd
   ```

2. Update the YAML front matter with your post details:
   - `title`: Your post title
   - `author`: Your name
   - `date`: Publication date
   - `categories`: List of relevant categories
   - `tags`: List of relevant tags
   - `image`: Path to your featured image
   - `description`: A brief description of your post

3. Write your content following the template structure:
   - Introduction
   - Background (if needed)
   - Main Content
   - Conclusion
   - References

## Best Practices

- Write clear, engaging introductions
- Use proper headings and subheadings
- Include code examples where relevant
- Add images to illustrate your points
- Link to external resources
- Keep paragraphs short and readable
- Use lists for better readability
- Include a clear conclusion

## Categories

Posts are organized into the following categories:
- Technical Tutorials
- Thoughts & Insights
- Project Updates

## Images

Add any images for your posts to the `images/` directory. Use descriptive filenames and include alt text for accessibility.
