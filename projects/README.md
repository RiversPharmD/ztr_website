# Project Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all my projects. Each project should be documented in its own `.qmd` file.

## Using the Template

1. Copy `_template.qmd` to create a new project file:
   ```bash
   cp _template.qmd my-project.qmd
   ```

2. Update the YAML front matter with your project details:
   - `title`: Your project name
   - `date`: When you started or completed the project
   - `status`: Current status (In Progress/Completed/On Hold)
   - `technologies`: List of technologies used
   - `github`: Link to your GitHub repository
   - `demo`: Link to live demo (if applicable)
   - `image`: Path to your project's featured image

3. Fill in the content sections:
   - Project Overview
   - Features
   - Technical Details
   - Implementation
   - Results
   - Future Improvements
   - Getting Started guide

4. Add any relevant images to the `images/` directory

## Best Practices

- Keep project documentation up to date
- Include screenshots and diagrams where helpful
- Provide clear installation and usage instructions
- Link to external resources and documentation
- Include code snippets that demonstrate key functionality
